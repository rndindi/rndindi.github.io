  Hi, I am a PhD Researcher at the Department of Mathematics and Computer science, University of Antwerp, Belgium.
  I have huge interests in database technology, data quality, tools and methods for efficient storage and analysis
  of data at scale.

  Specifically, my research has mostly been on data cleaning, entity resolution using clustering methods and query
  approximation techniques for big data.
